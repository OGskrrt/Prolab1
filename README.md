More precise geometric shape analyse will be here soon...


A company that carries out natural resource exploration and extraction operations in the seas
Search area with the most accurate number and optimal dimensions in order to obtain maximum profit.
It aims to divide the land into divided areas (parcels). For this purpose, according to certain rules
performs the most appropriate area partitioning along with profit-cost calculations and
A software was developed that creates a visual map of segmented search areas.

STAGE 1:

The first phase of the project constitutes the seismic research leg of the resource exploration company. The area of ​​the closed shape formed by combining the given coordinate points is the resource reserve.
It will correspond to 1/10 of the amount. Accordingly, the reserve area will be drawn and divided into parcels in accordance with the coordinates on the given website. Afterwards, the necessary mathematical operations will be performed and the amount of resources will be found.

STAGE 2:

In the second stage of the project, the reserve value amount was determined based on surface areas in the first stage.
It constitutes the drilling and resource extraction part of the resource exploration company in the selected regions.
For this purpose, the reserve areas whose shapes were drawn in the first stage must be divided into regular square pieces of certain sizes in the most optimal way.
